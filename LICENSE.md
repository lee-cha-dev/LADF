## LADF Personal License (Non-Commercial)
**© 2026 Lazy Software. All rights reserved.**

This is a non-commercial license for **LADF (Lazy Analytics Dashboard Framework)**, a **component/runtime library** used to render and operate dashboard widgets and related UI features.

If you are an **organization** (including a non-profit), or if you are using LADF for **Production** or **Commercial** purposes, you must obtain a paid commercial subscription from Lazy Software.

---

## 1) Grant (Personal, Non-Commercial)

Subject to timely compliance with this license, Lazy Software grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and modify LADF solely for **Personal, Non-Commercial use**.

You may create derivative works for Personal, Non-Commercial use.

No other rights are granted.

---

## 2) Definitions

**Personal Use** means use by an individual natural person solely for learning, experimentation, and hobby projects, and not connected to or primarily intended for any business purpose.

**Non-Commercial Use** means not for commercial advantage or monetary compensation, and not for internal business purposes.

**Commercial Use** means any use of LADF, directly or indirectly, that is:

- for a business, company, **non-profit organization**, government entity, or other organization; or
- on behalf of a third party (including a client, customer, employer, or contractor); or
- intended for commercial advantage, monetary compensation, revenue generation, cost reduction, operational benefit, or internal business purposes; or
- used to provide a product or service to third parties (including SaaS, hosted services, consulting deliverables, paid support, or paid training).

Commercial Use includes (without limitation) internal dashboards, internal analytics tools, internal reporting systems used by an organization, embedding LADF in a product offered commercially, or using LADF for client work.

**Production Use** means use of LADF in a live or operational environment that is relied upon for business operations, customer-facing services, or day-to-day workflows.

**Generated Output** means source code, configuration, assets, or other materials generated by Lazy Software tooling (e.g., Lazy Dashboards) from user-provided inputs, datasets, schemas, prompts, settings, or selections.

**Authorized Distribution** means distribution of a Personal, Non-Commercial project that **includes** LADF as a dependency as part of that project (e.g., a student assignment repository), provided you do not distribute LADF as a standalone library/framework/SDK and you comply with Section 6.

---

## 3) What LADF Is (Component/Runtime Library)

LADF is a component and runtime library used to render dashboard widgets, visualizations, layouts, interactions, themes, and associated UI functionality (the “Components”).

---

## 4) Generated Output Ownership (Customer Keeps Their Code)

Generated Output is **not** LADF. This license does not restrict ownership of Generated Output created from your inputs.

You may retain and modify Generated Output even if this license ends.

However, using LADF to compile/build/run/render/execute Generated Output in **Production** or for **Commercial Use** is Commercial/Production use of LADF and requires a paid commercial subscription.

---

## 5) Restrictions

You may not:

- Use LADF for Commercial Use or Production Use.
- Sublicense, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise commercialize LADF.
- **Redistribute LADF as a standalone library/framework/SDK** (including hosting LADF by itself for download).
- Remove or alter copyright, trademark, or license notices.
- Use Lazy Software trademarks, branding, or logos except to truthfully attribute origin.

---

## 6) Authorized Distributions (Non-Commercial Only)

You may make **Authorized Distributions** only if you:

- do so only for Personal, Non-Commercial purposes;
- include this `LICENSE.md` in full and keep all notices intact; and
- clearly state that the distribution is under this LADF Personal License (Non-Commercial).

For clarity:

- You may share a Personal project repository that **uses** LADF (e.g., an example app or student assignment), so long as you are not distributing LADF as a standalone library/framework/SDK.
- You may not charge money for LADF itself or access to LADF (including paywalls, paid downloads, or “donation required” distribution).
- Any use of LADF in Production or for Commercial Use requires a paid commercial subscription, even if the project is otherwise open.

## 7) Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

---

## 8) Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LAZY SOFTWARE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL.

IN NO EVENT WILL LAZY SOFTWARE’S TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED USD $100.

---

## 9) Termination

This license terminates automatically if you breach any term. Upon termination, you must stop using LADF and delete all copies of LADF in your possession or control.

For clarity: termination affects rights to LADF only. It does not transfer ownership of Generated Output you created.

---

## 10) Governing Law

This license is governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas, USA.

---

## 11) Severability

If any provision of this license is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this license will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

---

## 12) Entire Agreement

This license constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relative to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, statements, or representations, whether oral or written.

---

## 13) Survival

The provisions of Sections 4 (Generated Output Ownership), 7 (Disclaimer of Warranty), 8 (Limitation of Liability), 9 (Termination Obligations), 10 (Governing Law), and Sections 11–13 will survive termination or expiration of this license.
