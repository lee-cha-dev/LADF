## LADF Commercial Subscription License

**© 2026 Lazy Software. All rights reserved.**

This is a subscription-based commercial license for **LADF (Lazy Analytics Dashboard Framework)**, a **component/runtime library** used to render and operate dashboard widgets and related UI features.

If you do not have a current, paid subscription with Lazy Software, you have **no rights** to use LADF for **Production** or **Commercial** purposes.

### 1) Grant (Limited to Subscription Term)

Subject to (a) timely payment, (b) compliance with this license, and (c) an active **Subscription Term**, Lazy Software grants Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license to use, copy, and modify LADF solely for Licensee’s **Commercial Use** and **Production Use** within the purchased scope.

All rights granted under this license are strictly limited to the **Subscription Term**. No perpetual rights are granted unless expressly provided in a separate written agreement signed by Lazy Software.

### 2) License Verification, Keys, and Enforcement (Intentional Behavior)

Licensee acknowledges LADF may include license enforcement mechanisms (“License Checks”), including one or more of the following:

* Requirement to provide a license key (or signed token).
* Periodic validation of the key/token.
* Online verification (“phone home”), including contacting Lazy Software servers.
* **Offline grace period** (e.g., LADF may cache a valid license and continue functioning for a limited time if validation cannot occur), followed by restricted mode if validation does not resume.
* Feature gating (e.g., disabling “Pro” features).
* Watermarking, warning banners, reduced functionality, or refusal to render.

Licensee agrees that any restricted-mode behavior triggered by missing/invalid/expired licensing, failed validation, or attempted circumvention is an intentional license-enforcement feature and **not** a defect, bug, or breach of warranty.

Licensee must not:

* Remove, disable, bypass, tamper with, or circumvent License Checks.
* Attempt to spoof or interfere with license validation.
* Distribute LADF with License Checks removed or altered.

Any circumvention attempt is a **material breach** that immediately terminates this license.

### 3) What LADF Is (Component/Runtime Library)

LADF is a component and runtime library used to render dashboard widgets, visualizations, layouts, interactions, themes, and associated UI functionality (the “Components”).

Licensee acknowledges LADF is not merely a “preview tool” and that LADF is required to compile, build, render, and/or execute dashboards produced by Lazy Dashboards or other pipelines when those dashboards use LADF Components.

### 4) Generated Output Ownership (Customer Keeps Their Code)

Lazy Software’s authoring tools (e.g., Lazy Dashboards) may generate source code, configs, assets, or other materials from Licensee inputs (“Generated Output”).

As between Lazy Software and Licensee:

* Licensee owns its Generated Output.
* Licensee may retain and modify its Generated Output even if this license ends.

However:

* Using LADF to compile/build/run/render/execute Generated Output in Production or for Commercial Use requires a current, paid LADF subscription under this license (or another valid commercial agreement with Lazy Software).

This clause preserves ownership of Generated Output while making clear that production execution of LADF Components is licensed subscription use.

### 5) Scope & Metrics (Order Form Controls)

License scope is defined by the applicable order form / invoice (“Order Form”) and may be limited by:

* Seats (developers/users who access or use LADF).
* Number of applications/projects/deployments.
* Environments (dev/stage/prod).
* Term length (monthly/annual).
* Support/SLA level (if any).

If there is any conflict, the Order Form controls.

### 6) Redistribution / OEM

Unless expressly granted in writing, Licensee may not:

* Redistribute LADF as a standalone library/framework/SDK.
* Offer LADF as a hosted service where LADF is the primary value.
* Grant third parties rights to LADF.

OEM/redistribution requires a separate OEM license.

### 7) Payment, Non-Payment, and Suspension

Commercial/Production use requires an active paid subscription.

If payment is overdue or the subscription is canceled or expires, Lazy Software may suspend license rights immediately. Suspension/expiration may cause License Checks to place LADF into restricted mode.

### 8) Support

Support is not included unless purchased. Support terms are defined in the Order Form or a separate support agreement.

### 9) Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

### 10) Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LAZY SOFTWARE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL.

IN NO EVENT WILL LAZY SOFTWARE’S TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO LAZY SOFTWARE FOR LADF IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

### 11) Termination / End of Subscription (Remove From Production)

This license terminates automatically upon the earliest of:

* Expiration or non-renewal of the Subscription Term.
* Cancellation of the subscription.
* Non-payment.
* Licensee’s material breach.

Upon termination (including end of Subscription Term), Licensee must:

* Immediately cease all Production Use and Commercial Use of LADF.
* Remove LADF from all production systems/environments, builds, deployments, and runtime images.
* Cease distributing any products that include LADF unless expressly permitted under an OEM license.
* Delete or archive copies of LADF, except one archival copy solely for compliance verification.

For clarity: Licensee may retain its Generated Output, but may not compile/build/run/render/execute LADF Components in Production or for Commercial Use without an active paid subscription.

### 12) Governing Law

This license is governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas, USA.

### 13) Contact / Purchase

Lazy Software — licensing@lazysoftware.example (PLACEHOLDER)

### 14) Severability

If any provision of this license is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this license will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

### 15) Entire Agreement

This license, together with the applicable Order Form, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relative to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, statements, or representations, whether oral or written.

### 16) Survival

The provisions of Sections 2 (License Verification), 4 (Generated Output Ownership), 7 (Payment), 9 (Disclaimer of Warranty), 10 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (Termination Obligations), 12 (Governing Law), and Sections 14–16 will survive the termination or expiration of this license.
